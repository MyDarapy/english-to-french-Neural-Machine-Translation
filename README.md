 translating English sentences to French using a seq2seq model that learns to encode the source sequences (English) into a fixed context vector C  and passing C into a decoder that predicts that the next word translation in the output sequence. LSTM hidden units were used to capture long term dependencies. Dataset: WMT'14 (en-fr) from HuggingFace
